         <h1>Contact With Your Child</h1>
         <p>When your child is placed with us, they will have a care plan that ensures all their needs are met while in
            our home.
            This plan is drafted and agreed by the Local Authority (LA) and will contain details regarding home visits
            and other
            contact arrangements with your child. Should you have any concerns about the planned contact presented in
            your child's
            care plan, it is important that you speak to their social worker. They will be able to explain to you the
            reasons for
            any restrictions their might be with contact. Depending on the details of the care plan, contact with your
            child may be
            at the home, over the phone or through virtual contact, at a neutral space in the community, at a registered
            contact
            centre, or at your own home.

         <h1>Visits To The Home</h1>
         <p>
            Your child's social worker will let you know where your child will be living. Once your child has been
            placed, the
            manager of the home will be in touch to discuss any concerns you might have and to answer any initial
            queries. The
            manager will also be able to plan your visit to the home with you, arranging times and dates and explaining
            our
            expectations.

         <h1>Agreed Expectations</h1>
         <p>
            Since other children may live at the children's home where your child has been placed, we must insist that
            you respect
            their privacy during any home visits. We ask that you take direction from the home's staff - this includes
            moving rooms
            and leaving the building, as well as any other reasonable requests.
            <br><br><br>
            Prior to your first visit, the home's manager will discuss any individual expectations for the home and you
            are expected
            to agree to these before visiting. If you are not happy with anything during your contact, either speak to
            the home's
            on-site manager, or ask a member of staff to contact the duty manager. They should be able to assist you
            with any
            concerns you may have.
            <br><br><br>
            We have a zero tolerance to abusive language, physical threats, or physical assault directed towards any of
            our staff or
            any children placed at the home. Should this occur, you will be instantly removed from the home.

         <h1>Support</h1>
         <p>We believe that the children in our homes have far better outcomes if the adults around them work together
            in their best
            interests. For this reason, we work closely with parents and carers to achieve this. As experienced child
            care
            professionals, we can provide advice and support to you in a variety of areas in line with your child's care
            plan. This
            can include help with transport for a contact visit, or assistance with your phone or streaming application
            for distance
            contact.

      <p class="info-content">
         If you are happy with the service that your child is receiving from the team at Next Stage 4 Life, feel free to
         let us
         know. We enjoy receiving compliments on our work and there are several ways in which to do this.
         <br><br><br>
         Each home has its own compliments book, where parents, carers, and other approved visitors can record any
         compliments
         they wish to make about the home itself or particular members of staff. If you prefer, you can email the home
         directly
         to the email address you will be given when your child is placed. Our Regulation 44 visitor may also contact
         you to ask
         if you wish to comment on the service we provide, or the home's manager may send you a feedback on which you
         can provide
         honest criticism and any compliments you may wish to make.
