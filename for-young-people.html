         <h1>How We Safeguard You</h1>
         <p>Our aim is to always keep you safe. This means that sometimes you might not be happy with the decisions we
            need to make
            to ensure that. You will have a risk assessment that will look at things that have happened to you in the
            past as well
            as things that are happening now. We will work with you (within your individual risk assessment) to minimise
            those
            risks, but there may be times when we cannot allow you to do certain things. The reason is that doing so
            might cause you
            harm.
            <br><br><br>
            All of our staff are trained to keep you safe, and we have a designated Safeguarding Lead whose job it is to
            ensure
            everyone under our care is safe. If you are unhappy about any of our decisions, you can speak to the
            Safeguarding Lead
            about them and they will discuss your concerns with the manager.
            <br><br><br>
            If you are ever unsafe, or should your give us any information that makes you unsafe or has made you unsafe
            in the past,
            we will take immediate action to keep you from any further harm. We will also be required to inform you
            social worker
            and we may also have to tell the police.

         <h1>How We Support You</h1>
         <p>
            Prior to your admission to the home, you will be given a Young Person's Guide. This will provide you with
            essential
            information about how you will be supported and looked after while you live with us.
            <br><br><br>
            You will receive one-to-one daily support from one of the six care staff we have working in the home. In
            addition, you
            will have a key worker assigned to you, who will support you in arranging your appointments, any meetings
            that you need
            to attend, and your education, as well as ensuring all of your health needs are met.
            <br><br><br>
            Each home also has a manager and an assistant manager on site. Their role is to support you by making sure
            that the
            staff looking after you do so in a way that meets your care, education, and health care needs.
            <br><br><br>
            As well as the team in the home, we also have several senior managers who regularly visit our homes and who
            can provide
            you with further support, should you need it.

      <div class="w-a-h-left-container-content">
         <h1>Contact with Family and Friends</h1>
         <p>It is important that you maintain contact with family and friends and your contact will be agreed as part of
            your plans
            when you come to live at the home, staff will facilitate your contact if that is part of your plan. Should
            any risks
            arise with your contact then a planning meeting may be called with your social worker to discuss this
            further. </p>

         <h1>Listening to Your Wishes and Feelings</h1>
         <p>
            While living in our homes, you will have plenty of opportunities to talk about your wishes and feelings. We
            are always
            available to listen to you and, wherever possible, we will do what we can to action any requests on your
            behalf.
            <br><br><br>
            Of course, there may be times when we cannot action your wishes. In these cases, we will always explain to
            you the
            reasons why we are unable to do something that you have requested.
            <br><br><br>
            If you are unhappy with any of the decisions made in the home by our support staff, then there are several
            people you
            can talk to about this. These include the in-house manager or assistant manager, as well as the Operations
            Manager and
            the Regulation 44 visitor to the home. You can also speak to your advocate about our decisions, should you
            have one, or
            your social worker. You can also speak to our regulatory body, Ofsted, or raise a formal complaint.

         How To Make A Complaint
      </h1>
      <p class="info-content">
         We work hard to ensure that we provide the highest standard of service and care to your child and always work
         with their
         best interests at heart. However, should be unhappy with our service, there are procedures in place for you
         make a
         complaint and the home's manager will be happy to provide you with a copy of our complaints policy.
         <br><br><br>
         We try to resolve any concerns you might have informally in the first instance. These issues can be raised at
         any time
         to any member of the home's management. If you would prefer to make a formal complaint, we must insist that
         these be
         made in writing to ensure that a thorough investigation takes place. Formal complaints may be made by email,
         text,
         letter, voice recording, or by filling in a third-party complaints form requested from the home. Formal
         complaints can
         be made directly to the home's manager or to our Operations Manager, Jack Smallman.
         <br><br><br>
         External complaints can be made to several professionals and regulatory bodies, including your child's social
         worker,
         their teacher, the Local Education Authority, our requesting a third-party complaints form from the home.
         Complaints can
         be made direct to the homes manager or the Operations manager (Linda Jennings) You can also make complaints
         external to
         the home to a range of professionals such as your child's social worker, teacher, the Regulation 44 visitor, or
         Ofsted.

         Your Plans
      </h1>
      <p class="info-content">
         While staying in our residential homes you will have your own individual plans that will help you set and
         attain
         achievable goals. These plans are reviewed on a regular basis (mainly by your key worker) and we encourage you
         to
         contribute to them.
         <br><br>
         There may be other plans - including Education, Health, and Care plans (EHCP) or plans put together by your
         social
         worker. You may also see these plans, though we will need to ask the person who wrote them for their permission
         to share
         them with you.
         <br><br>
         If you are not happy with any of your plans, feel free to speak to the manager, the operations manager, or your
         social
         worker.
