      <h1>Our Approach</h1>
      <div class="our-approach-left">
         <img src="/images/our-approach-left.jpg" alt="">
         <p>We provide therapeutic care to children and young people between the ages of 7 and 18 in our residential
            children's
            homes. These homes are fully-registered under the Care Standards Act 2000 and we work within the legal
            framework set out
            by the Children's Homes Regulations and Quality Standards 2015 and other associated legislation. Our
            regulatory body is
            Ofsted, who perform regular inspections to ensure we are working to the appropriate standard.
            <br><br><br>
            Our primary model of therapy is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). However, we will use other therapeutic
            methods,
            depending on the individual needs of the child or young person in question. These may include psychotherapy,
            play
            therapy, or other methods. All therapy is provided by an in house therapist, employed directly by the
            company on a
            full-time basis.
            <br><br><br>
            Therapeutic intervention can be provided individually to the child or young person, or via intervention with
            the home's
            support staff to deliver a therapeutic environment. Depending on the circumstances, we can put together an
            approach that
            allows for both possibilities.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="our-approach-right">
         <p>Other health matters can be accessed through partner organisations such as Children and Adolescent Mental
            Health
            Services (CAMHS) or universal health services.
            <br><br><br>
            The child or young person's education is provided through the Local Education Authority (LEA) and some of
            the young
            people in our care will be subject to an Education, Health, and Care Plan (EHCP).
            <br><br><br>
            All of our homes are large, detached properties that provide our residents with full access to local
            amenities within
            their community. This ensures that they can expect the same chances and aspirations as children and young
            people of
            similar age who are not in the care system.
            <br><br><br>
            Each child and young person will have their own individual plans tailored to meet their particular needs
            while in our
            homes. These plans are followed by our entire staff to ensure a high standard of service delivery that
            safeguards every
            child and young person in our care.
